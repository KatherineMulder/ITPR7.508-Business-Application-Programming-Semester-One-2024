## 1. Introduction
> provide an overview of the entire document

### 1.1 Document Purpose
Describe the purpose of the SDD and its intended audience.

### 1.2 Subject Scope
<!-- TODO -->

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

### 1.4 Document Overview
Describe what the rest of the document contains and how it is organized.

### 1.5 business issues and justifications of decisions
Reflection/Analysis of the business issues and justifications of decisions that you have agreed to. 

### 1.6 program specifications
Reflection/Analysis of the program specifications. Include any changes or modifications that may be 
required for the final software application.  

## 2. Design
> 

### 2.1 Entity Relationship Diagram 
> 


### 2.2 User Requirement Specification
> business rules

#### 2.3 Data Flow Diagram
> we can discuss which one we want to use 
https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-UML-unified-modeling-language

diagrams as DFD or UML) for the user interface, the client-server setup, and the 
individual processes within the software application.  

#### 2.2.2 Composition
Describes the way the design subject is (recursively) structured into constituent subsystems and (pluggable) components, buy vs. build, reuse of components. Can be broken down into Logical and Physical composition viewpoints. Example visualization languages include UML package diagram, UML component diagram, UML deployment diagram.

#### 2.2.3 Logical
Describes static structure such as classes, interfaces, and their relationships. Example visualization languages include UML class diagram, and UML object diagram.

#### 2.2.4 Dependency
Interconnection, sharing, and parameterization

#### 2.2.5 Information
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.6 Patterns
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.7 Interface
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.8 Structure
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.9 Interaction
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.10 State dynamics
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.11 Algorithm
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.12 Resources
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.13 Physical
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.14 Deployment
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.15 Concurrency
<!-- TODO -->
#### 2.2.16 Behavioral
<!-- TODO -->

### 2.3 Views
> This sub-section, depending on the nature of the design activity, should contain enough information to implement the product (prescriptive architecture) or enough information for others to understand how to maintain or adapt the existing product (descriptive architecture).

> The specific views should:
* Be uniquely identifiable
* Identify the viewpoint of which it is an instance
* Provide the view representation according to the viewpoint languages
* Record the relevant design decisions made as they relate to the presented view's elements, see IEEE 42010:2011 5.8.2

## 3. Testing



## 4. software development
Katherine suggestion:
* web application
* HTMl and CSS 
* Python 
* flask framework
* chart.js 
* flask testing for unit tests
