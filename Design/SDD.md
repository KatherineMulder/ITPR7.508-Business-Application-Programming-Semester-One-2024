## 6. Data Design
### 6.1 Entity Relationship Diagram
> The purpose of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is to visually represent the structure of the database for the home loan monitor. By mapping out entities like "User," "mortgage," "override payment,"and so on, along with their attributes and relationships, the ERD will provide a clear understanding of how data is organized within the system. This visualization will aid in the design and development of the tool, ensuring it effectively manages home loans by calculating payments, tracking interest rates, and facilitating management of multiple mortgages. <br>

### 6.2 Data Flow Diagram
> The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) serves to illustrate the flow of data within the system, showing how data is input, processed, and output. It helps in understanding the flow of information and the interactions between different components within the software. <br>
